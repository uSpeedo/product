### **Text messages are charged per segment**
-A single SMS message technically supports up to 160 characters, or up to 70 if the message contains one or more Unicode characters (such as Chinese characters).

-Messages longer than 160 characters are automatically split into 153-character "segments". 
For example, a 161-character message will be sent as two messages: one with 153 characters and a second with eight characters.

-Messages which contain one or more Unicode characters more than 70 characters will be split into 67-character segments.
