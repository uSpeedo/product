bellow. All information provided is complete and accurate. The Agreement shall be effective on the date at which time the account is created and verified.</p><p>uSpeedo and Customer are together referred to as the &quot;Parties&quot; and each a &quot;Party&quot;.</p><p>In consideration of the terms and covenants set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows.</p><ol><li><p><strong>uSpeedo&#x27;s Services</strong>. uSpeedo offers a variety of communication-enabling services (&quot;Services&quot;) described at <a href="https://uspeedo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://uspeedo.com</a>(the &quot;Site&quot;), which include its APIs, SDKs, software, code snippets, documentation, technical support, the Site itself provided through uSpeedo&#x27;s proprietary platform. </p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Account</strong>.

Customer must notify uSpeedo promptly of any change in Customer&#x27;s eligibility to use the Services (including any changes to or revocation of any licenses from state authorities), breach of security or any known unauthorized use of Customer&#x27;s Account. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer may delete its Account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@uspeedo.com." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@uspeedo.com.</a> Notwithstanding deletion of Customer&#x27;s Account, uSpeedo may retain Customer data as reasonably necessary for compliance with applicable law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fees and Payment</strong>   </p></li></ol><ul><li>a.
