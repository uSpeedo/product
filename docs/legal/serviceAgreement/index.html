“Services”) and affirming that you (the entity agreeing to the terms, “you” or “Customer”) agree to our terms of service through the sign-up process, you are entering into a master service agreement (the “Agreement”) with the legal entity set out below, which shall be referred to as “we”, “our”, “us” or “UM”.</p><p>The account creator represents and confirms to UM that you are the duly authorised representative and signatory of the Customer to act for and on behalf of the Customer to enter into the Agreement and accepts the General Terms of Services and all other terms, as set out bellow. All information provided is complete and accurate. The Agreement shall be effective on the date at which time the account is created and verified.</p><p>UM and Customer are together referred to as the “Parties” and each a “Party”.</p><p>In consideration of the terms and covenants set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows.</p><ol><li><p><strong>UM&#x27;s Services</strong>. UM offers a variety of communication-enabling services (&quot;Services&quot;) described at <a href="https://uspeedo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://uspeedo.com</a>(the &quot;Site&quot;), which include its APIs, SDKs, software, code snippets, documentation, technical support, the Site itself provided through UM&#x27;s proprietary platform. </p></li><li><p><strong>Customer Account</strong>. To access and use certain Services, Customer must create an account (&quot;Account&quot;) on the Site. Customer shall provide accurate, complete, and current Account information and, as applicable, timely update the same. Customer is solely responsible for the activity that occurs on its Account (which includes its sub-accounts), and for keeping its Account password secure. UM will not be liable for losses caused by any unauthorized use of the Account; Customer represents and warrants that it is duly authorized to do business and use the Services in all jurisdictions in which Customer operates. Customer must notify UM promptly of any change in Customer&#x27;s eligibility to use the Services (including any changes to or revocation of any licenses from state authorities), breach of security or any known unauthorized use of Customer&#x27;s Account. Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer may delete its Account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@uspeedo.com." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support@uspeedo.com.</a> Notwithstanding deletion of Customer&#x27;s Account, UM may retain Customer data as reasonably necessary for compliance with applicable law.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fees and Payment</strong>   </p></li></ol><ul><li>a. Paid Services. Customer agrees to pay for its use of the Services as set forth on the pricing page on the Site, as may be updated from time to time, except and only to the extent Customer has entered a separate written agreement or addendum with UM or formal emails confirmed by both parties for special pricing on certain Services and/or country-specific pricing.UM reserves the right to change pricing from time to time, effective upon notice to Customer; such notification may be provided via emails. Customer&#x27;s continued use of the Services after a price change becomes effective constitutes Customer&#x27;s agreement to pay the changed amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Services shall be subject to the initial pricing (the &quot;Custom Pricing&quot;) and other terms. </li><li>b. Billing. Customer shall pay in advance for the Services in the currency specified by UM. Some of the Services may accept recurring period charges as agreed to by Customer on the Site. By choosing such auto-reload payment plan, Customer acknowledges that such Services have a recurring payment feature and Customer accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. CUSTOMER MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR ITS BILLING ACCOUNT. IF CUSTOMER HAS REQUESTED AUTO-RELOAD PAYMENTS, CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP ITS BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CUSTOMER MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY UM OR ITS PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CUSTOMER&#x27;S PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CUSTOMER BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF CUSTOMER&#x27;S USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE IN THE ACCOUNT DASHBOARD. IF CUSTOMER FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT UM MAY CONTINUE CHARGING CUSTOMER FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER THE BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS CUSTOMER HAS CANCELLED AUTO-RELOAD OR TERMINATED ITS PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE. </li><li>c. Taxes. Unless otherwise provided on the pricing page on the Site, all charges and fees for the Services are exclusive of any country, province, federal, state or local taxes, including without limitation, use, sales, value-added, privilege, or other taxes, levies, imports, duties, fees, surcharges, governmental assessments and withholdings (&quot;Taxes&quot;).

Customer may present UM with an exemption certificate eliminating Customer&#x27;s and UM&#x27;s liability to pay certain Taxes. Once UM has received and approved the exemption certificate, Customer shall be exempt from those Taxes on a going-forward basis. If, a taxing jurisdiction determines that Customer is not exempt from Taxes and assesses those taxes, Customer shall pay those Taxes to UM plus any applicable interest or penalties.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>License</strong>.
